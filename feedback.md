NOTE:tutorial-part 1 branch already has a lot of things set up.

### 3. Code conversion and type declarations

** "does not have, TypeScript will bitch about it."** 

As Im getting close to having kids, I'm really watching how I speak and create a environment of inclusivity. While I will slip and say it (obviously channeling my inner Jessie from Breaking Bad), I'd never write it. It's your tutorial and all. But just something I wanted to point out.  


**"And now you runn `npm run tsc` again, you should get no errors"**

I actually got an error!
```
src/app.ts:4:10 - error TS2616: 'path' can only be imported by using 'import path = require("path")' or a default import.
```

## Part 2

### 3. Start Building

**Continue to add more tabs by duplicating homepage.vue. We name the files camera.vue and profile.vue:
VueJS file structure**
**Import them into home.vue:**

The codeblock labels are inaccurate. All three tabs say `label: 'Home',`
