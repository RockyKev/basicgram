## PART 1 - 

NOTE:tutorial-part 1 branch already has a lot of things set up.

From initial reading, I thought I was supposed to pull it! 
Maybe a comment about how you can pull that branch to check your work. 

### Folder Structure

Am I supposed to make a 'view' folder?

### 3. Code conversion and type declarations

** "does not have, TypeScript will bitch about it."** 

As Im getting close to having kids, I'm really watching how I speak and create a environment of inclusivity. While I will slip and say it (obviously channeling my inner Jessie from Breaking Bad), I'd never write it. It's your tutorial and all. But just something I wanted to point out.  


**"And now you runn `npm run tsc` again, you should get no errors"**

I actually got an error!
```
src/app.ts:4:10 - error TS2616: 'path' can only be imported by using 'import path = require("path")' or a default import.
```
